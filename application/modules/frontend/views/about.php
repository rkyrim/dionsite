			<p>Early in 2015, Dennis and Jacky had problems searching for someone to look after their daughter while having the need to attend regular meetings with their financial mentor.</p>
			<p>Concurrently, the couple was able to witness a number of nannies in their residential community leaving their employers on short notice causing the latter unprepared.</p>
			<!-- <p class="story-tagline">"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elite."</p> -->
			<p>So they came up with an idea of having an online community, where finding a nanny would be easy by just doing a few clicks. It was their desire to help families like them to have an easy, fast, accessible and reliable platform of finding their care needs - without having to go through the pain of waiting, without an assurance, if they can get back to their usual activities any time soon.</p>
			<p>At the same time, it was also their desire to uplift the “nanny” brand in the Philippines and be able to give back to the community by opening doors of local job opportunities to people who don’t just work but provide care for the people who are dear to us.</p>
